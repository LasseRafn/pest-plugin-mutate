## Roadmap

We are going to release new beta versions on a regular basis.

A stable version will be released at [Laracon US](https://laracon.us/) by the end of August 2024.

To stay but to date, star the repository and follow it closely.

Another option is to follow Sandro Gehri on **[Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/gehrisandro)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandro-gehri-02150b41/)**, where I will post tips and tricks, and updates about the ongoing development.
